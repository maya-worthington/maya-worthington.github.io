            <p>A choropleth map is a thematic map where areas (such as countries or regions) are shaded or patterned in
                proportion to the value of a statistical variable being represented, such as population density,
                election results, or in this case, access to drinking water. Some benefits of it being that it makes
                complex data easily understandable through visual colour gradients which then makes it useful to
                identify geographic patterns and disparities. Some negatives are that it can oversimplify data,
                especially in large countries where regional differences are not shown, and the choice of colour scale
                or class intervals can distort perceptions of the map.</p>

            <p>The map presented is a choropleth map visualising data related to the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)
                6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. More specifically,
                it highlights Target 6.1: By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable
                drinking water for all. The indicator used is Indicator 6.1.1: Proportion of population using safely
                managed drinking water services, which measures the percentage of people in each country who had access
                to drinking water from an improved source that is located on premises, available when needed, and free
                from contamination. The data shown is from the year 2022, and countries are colored in a range of blue
                tones representing increasing levels of access from 0% to 100%. For full metadata and methodology on
                this indicator, refer to the official SDG indicator metadata page:
                https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=6&Target=6.1
                <br /><br />
                To create this map, I began by joining the clean global data sheet layer with the dataset for my
                selected indicator, SDG indicator 6.1.1. Once the layers were joined, I verified that the data matched
                correctly by year and country to ensure accuracy. I then created a choropleth map by adjusting the
                symbology settings and selecting a blue graduated colour ramp as it was talking about water.Â

            <p>For this map, utilising HTML I managed to make the same choropleth map into an interactive version of the
                same SDG indicator.

                In general there appeared to be several countries that had 100% of the population using safely managed
                drinking water services, countries like New Zealand, Kuwait, Iceland, Monaco, Singapore, Hungary, Hong
                Kong, Macao, Gibraltar, San Marino, Saint Barthelemy and Liechtenstein. The only negative is the lack of
                data that was available for several countries.
