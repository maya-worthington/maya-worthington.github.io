            <p>Land use classification maps show what the land is being used for, like if it's covered in trees,
                buildings, water, or farmland. They're made using satellite images and help us see patterns that we
                would not pick up on just by looking at the land. They're really useful for planning stuff like where to
                protect nature, where to build, or where we might want to reforest.
                <br /><br />
                For this assignment, I worked with satellite imagery in ArcGIS Pro to explore different ways of
                classifying land use and vegetation, using both supervised and unsupervised methods. Supervised
                classification means you train the system by giving it example areas of different land types (like water
                , vegetation, or urban areas), and it uses that to classify the rest of the image. Unsupervised
                classification, on the other hand, groups pixels based on similarities in their data without any
                guidance, you do not tell it what is what, it just finds patterns. I focused on the island of Curaçao.
                Each map gave me a different insight, and while some methods worked better than others, they all helped
                me understand what these tools are capable of (and where they fall short). Some maps went smoothly,
                others did not go to plan, but that was all part of figuring things out.

            <p>This map used a false colour band combo (Bands 8, 4, 3) which allows us to visualise wavelengths that the
                human eye cannot see revealing details about vegetation health, water bodies, urban areas, and other
                features that would be difficult to distinguish in a regular, true-color picture. This particular map
                highlights vegetation in red, with brighter reds showing healthier or denser plant cover. You can see
                vegetation mainly in the northeast and southeast of the island. Built-up areas appear grey or pink,
                while bare ground shows up in brown tones. Water bodies are dark, and white cloud cover is visible in
                the south and west.

        <div class="row">
            <p>This map is created with a true colour composite using Bands 4, 3, and 2, which shows the area as it
                would look to the human eye. This map was useful as a reference to compare with the false colour and
                classification maps. It helped me check whether the land cover types in the classified outputs actually
                matched what is visible in real life. On its own, it does not reveal much about vegetation health or land
                use differences, but it is still helpful for orientation and for spotting obvious features like urban
                areas, beaches, or dense forest.

        <div class="row">
            <p>Before diving into classification, I used the spectral profile tool to look at how different land cover
                types reflect light across various bands. I selected sample areas for vegetation, urban spaces, water,
                terrain and clouds, and created a chart comparing their reflectance values. This helped me understand
                the differences between land types from the software’s perspective and also made it easier to choose
                training samples for the supervised classification.

        <div class="row">
            <p>Next, I attempted to run an unsupervised pixel-based classification for Curaçao, but I ran into constant
                issues. Every time I tried to run the tool, it gave me an error message about missing stats and
                rescaling pixel values, and sometimes it even crashed ArcGIS Pro completely. I suspect it had to do with
                the raster file being in the wrong format or missing metadata. After multiple failed attempts, I decided
                to skip the pixel-based version and go ahead with the unsupervised object-based classification instead.
                That one ran fine, but the results were not great, it grouped everything too generally, with most of the
                island appearing green, and even confused water and terrain in some spots. It gave a rough idea of land
                cover patterns but did not feel reliable or detailed enough to use for proper analysis.

        <div class="row">
            <p>In contrast, the supervised pixel-based classification of Curaçao, turned out to be the strongest and
                most accurate result. Because I trained the classification using known land types, the output showed
                clear, realistic boundaries that closely matched what you would expect to see on the ground. It took more
                time and required some trial and error when selecting training data, but the result felt meaningful and
                detailed.

            <p>Next, I created NDVI vegetation health maps, one with a rainbow colour ramp and one with a yellow-green
                gradient. The rainbow version showed fine variation in vegetation but was harder to interpret because of
                the sharp colour changes. The yellow-green version was much clearer, it showed where vegetation was
                strongest and where it was sparse, which would be useful for reforestation or conservation planning. One
                common issue throughout most of the maps was the appearance of the clouds, they tended to mix up the map
                analysis outcomes.
