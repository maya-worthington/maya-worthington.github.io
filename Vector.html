            <p>To create the final map, we used a combination of mobile data collection through ArcGIS Field Maps and
                spatial analysis tools within ArcGIS Online. The process began with collecting vector data in the field
                using mobile devices from a survey that we created as a class. Each participant contributed points by
                filling out a shared form that automatically geotagged observations such as sidewalk condition or the
                amount of bikes parked. This data was uploaded directly into ArcGIS Online, where it could be accessed
                and analysed in real time.
                <br /><br />
                Had to learn how to use ArcGIS software and so took a course on the basics of it and received a
                certificate for the completion of the course.
