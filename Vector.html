        <h3>Vector Spatial Analysis</h3>
        <div class="line"> </div>

        <div class="row">
            <p>Vector spatial analysis maps are useful for showing how different features, like sidewalks, trees, or
                neighbourhood boundaries, relate to each other in space. Using points, lines, and polygons, they allow
                you to see things like how dense a feature is, how close it is to something else, or how it’s
                distributed across an area. This becomes really important when trying to understand things like
                accessibility, infrastructure quality, or where green space is lacking. These maps can reveal spatial
                patterns that aren’t obvious at first glance, which makes them really powerful for urban or
                environmental planning.
                <br /><br />
                To create the final map, we used a combination of mobile data collection through ArcGIS Field Maps and
                spatial analysis tools within ArcGIS Online. The process began with collecting vector data in the field
                using mobile devices from a survey that we created as a class. Each participant contributed points by
                filling out a shared form that automatically geotagged observations such as sidewalk condition or the
                amount of bikes parked. This data was uploaded directly into ArcGIS Online, where it could be accessed
                and analysed in real time.
                <br /><br />
                Had to learn how to use ArcGIS software and so took a course on the basics of it and received a
                certificate for the completion of the course.

            <p>Then, using the data collected through the mobile app in ArcGIS, I attempted to analyse sidewalk
                conditions in relation to the population density of different neighbourhoods in Utrecht. I did this by
                aggregating the sidewalk condition points to the population density layer. However, the results mostly
                reflected the amount of data collected per area—meaning neighbourhoods with more recorded points
                appeared to have worse or better conditions simply because more data was submitted there. This made the
                analysis unreliable. If the sidewalk condition categories had been assigned numerical values (e.g., 1–3)
                , we could have calculated average condition scores per area, which would allow for a clearer
                distinction between neighbourhoods with good and poor sidewalk infrastructure. Furthermore, the overall
                amount of data collected was too limited to draw strong conclusions. This first map is therefore just
                meant to show both datasets separately:
            </p>

        <div class="IMG big" style="
            background: url('IMG/mayaMapsVector1.jpg') center/cover no-repeat;
            aspect-ratio: 1282/661;"></div>
        <div class="row">
            <p>This next map shows the actual spatial analysis of both datasets:
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="IMG big" style="
            background: url('IMG/mayaMapsVector2.jpg') center/cover no-repeat;
            aspect-ratio: 1003/661;"></div>
        <div class="row">
            <p>My next idea was to incorporate data on transit stops to see how they relate to areas with good sidewalk
                conditions, or whether they might have a negative impact on those areas. I found a dataset called World
                Transit Stops in the ArcGIS database and attempted to run some analysis. However, I wasn’t able to
                proceed because the tools I needed required more credits than I had available, one of the major
                drawbacks of using the online version of ArcGIS without a paid subscription.
                <br /><br />
                So instead, I decided to take a different approach for the spatial analysis, something I could actually
                carry out. I downloaded two datasets from ArcGIS: one showing the number of trees in Utrecht, and
                another showing the administrative divisions between municipalities, which helped provide clearer
                geographic context. I used the Density tool to visualise the distribution and quantity of trees across
                the city. For the symbology, I chose a yellow-to-green gradient to represent tree density, as I thought
                it was visually fitting and thematically appropriate.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="IMG big" style="
            background: url('IMG/mayaMapsVector3.jpg') center/cover no-repeat;
            aspect-ratio: 1003/661;"></div>
        <div class="row">
            <p>The visualisation reveals that tree coverage is densest in the central and western parts of the city,
                while the southern and southeastern areas show noticeably lower levels of vegetation. The distribution
                appears uneven, likely due to varying land use across the city, for example, higher density in
                residential or park areas and lower density in more built-up or industrial zones. This map is useful for
                identifying which neighbourhoods have access to urban green space and where additional tree planting or
                greening efforts could be prioritised.
