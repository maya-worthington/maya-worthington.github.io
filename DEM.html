            <P>Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is a digital representation of the Earth’s surface that shows elevation
                values in a grid. It’s used to analyse terrain features like slope, aspect, and drainage. Within this,
                a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) shows the bare ground surface, removing trees and buildings, making it
                useful for landform and hydrological analysis. In contrast, a Digital Surface Model (DSM) includes all
                features on the surface, like vegetation and structures, which is valuable in urban planning or
                visibility studies. While subtle, the difference between DTM and DSM significantly affects how we
                interpret elevation data.
                <br /><br />
                To construct the maps, I began by selecting a region of interest around the Dommel River in the southern
                Netherlands, an area that offered a clear contrast between natural terrain and human-modified
                landscapes. I downloaded the DTM, DSM, and RGB datasets, then merged the relevant tiles in QGIS to
                create continuous elevation layers. Clipping these layers to the extent of the historical map helped
                reduce file size and focus the analysis on the relevant area.
                <br /><br />
                I styled the DTM using cooler tones to emphasise terrain and applied warmer colours to the DSM to
                highlight buildings and tree cover. Adding hillshading further enhanced the legibility of subtle
                elevation changes, particularly along the riverbanks. The old map from 1816 was georeferenced using
                identifiable control points and layered with partial transparency over the modern elevation data,
                allowing for direct comparison. This overlay revealed how the landscape had been reshaped, through
                redirected rivers, modified floodplains, and urban expansion. While technical, the process ultimately
                became interpretative, combining spatial data with historical context to trace patterns of environmental
                and anthropogenic change.

        <div class="row">
            <p>The first map presents the DSM with hillshading, using a warm-toned colour ramp to highlight surface
                elevation and structures such as buildings and trees. The addition of shadow effects makes vertical
                features more legible, especially in urban zones where surface texture is dense. The heart-shaped
                lake in the lower centre, for instance, stands out more sharply due to this effect, underscoring the
                urban modification of the natural landscape.

        <div class="IMG big" style="

            aspect-ratio: 625 / 416.21;"></div>
        <div class="row">
            <p>In contrast, the second map visualises the DTM with hillshading, styled in cooler blues and greens to
                emphasise the underlying terrain without interference from vegetation or built structures. This map
                offers a clearer view of natural elevation changes—subtle though they may be in the Dutch context—and is
                particularly effective in tracing the course and floodplain of the Dommel River.

        <div class="IMG big" style="

        <div class="row">
            <p>The third map overlays the DTM and shadow layer onto the historical 1816 map, allowing for a direct
                visual comparison between past and present landscapes. The transparency applied to the modern elevation
                model allows the river path and historical land use patterns to emerge beneath. Notably, some of the
                older meanders of the Dommel now sit awkwardly against current terrain features, suggesting modification
                over time.

            <p>Finally, the fourth map uses RGB imagery to show the present-day land cover in true colour. This base
                map, while visually familiar, becomes especially powerful when compared with the previous ones, as it
                contextualises spatial patterns seen in elevation data. Agricultural fields, forested areas, and urban
                spread are all immediately distinguishable, providing a tangible connection between elevation and land
                use. Together, these maps tell a layered story, one where terrain, human activity, and time converge to
                reshape the river’s surroundings in subtle but persistent ways.
