        <h3>Carbon Sequestration</h3>
        <div class="line"> </div>

        <div class="row">
            <p>The Carbon Sequestration Potential Index (CSPI) reflects the ability of land areas to store carbon in
                vegetation, and is calculated based on three main variables: Gross Primary Production (GPP), Aboveground
                Carbon Density (ACD), and Forest Cover (FC). These indicators help identify which areas are already
                functioning as strong carbon sinks and which have potential for reforestation or improved land
                management.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>GPP represents the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by plants through photosynthesis. This gives us
                    insight into how active and productive the vegetation is.</li>
                <li>ACD refers to the amount of carbon stored in the biomass of trees, shrubs, and other aboveground
                    vegetation. High ACD areas are key for conservation because they hold large carbon stocks.</li>
                <li>FC indicates the percentage of land covered by forest, which supports both existing carbon storage
                    and future sequestration capacity.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>For this assignment I chose to focus on Cyprus as it is a geographically diverse island, featuring
                mountain ranges like the Troodos and Kyrenia, the central Mesaoria Plain, and an extensive coastline.
                It has a Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and mild, wetter winters. While the island enjoys
                over 300 days of sunshine a year, the Troodos Mountains receive the most rainfall, conditions that
                directly influence vegetation health and carbon uptake. This range in topography and climate makes
                Cyprus a good example to examine both existing carbon sinks and areas that could benefit from
                restoration.

        <div class="row">
            <p>The map was built using Google Earth Engine (GEE). I began by selecting Cyprus as my region of interest
                (ROI) and uploading its shapefile to the GEE platform. I then downloaded the ESA Aboveground Biomass
                GeoTIFF dataset that includes Cyprus, based on the islandâ€™s latitude and longitude. After importing the
                file into GEE and replacing the sample ROI in the script, I ran the calculations to generate ACD, GPP,
                FC, and CSPI layers. Cyprus covers roughly 3.6 million hectares, and the CSPI map allows us to visually
                compare areas of high carbon storage versus areas with potential for more vegetation growth. The values
                for mean GPP, ACD, FC, and CSPI were extracted directly from the console in GEE.

            <p>The conservation area I identified, found in Southwest Central Cyprus, shows high ACD, meaning these
                zones already store significant carbon in their forests or dense vegetation. These areas should be
                prioritised for protection to avoid future emissions and support biodiversity. In contrast, the
                reforestation area found in Northeast Central Cyprus had low ACD but moderate GPP, indicating it
                does not store much carbon yet but is biologically active. That makes it an ideal candidate for
                replanting, as it could significantly increase its carbon storage capacity over time.
